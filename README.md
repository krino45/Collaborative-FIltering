# Collaborative Filtering - brute force implementation.

A pretty small coursework project for the DSA class. Includes a ~80k names file, 525 movie names that I took from somewhere. Outputs a CSV file with calculated correlations. Input size in a variable in the DEFINE statement, its really resource heavy so I don't recommend running it (at full power)
